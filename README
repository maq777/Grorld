Grorld

Description:
Grorld is an application to automatically grind bonus resources in
CivWorld. As soon as one of these bonus bubbles appear on the screen
this application will automatically move the mouse to that location.
Hence you can have the computer grab bonuses all night while you
sleep...

Usage:
 - Use the command "./grorld" from the directory where you installed
   it to start the application.
 
Installation:
 - Run "sudo apt-get install cmake libx11-dev libcv-dev libcvaux-dev
   libhighgui-dev && cmake . && make" from the directory where the
   source is located. Follow the instructions.

Attention:
 - Do NOT move the browser while playing
 - Always have the browser window at front
